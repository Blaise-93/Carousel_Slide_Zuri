In this Zuri week 7 assignment, I created Carousel/Slideshow with 6 different car images.
I made sure that:
images are properly styled,
directional icons (previous and next Icons ) are shown on the images only when hovered,
on clicking the icons, it showed the next/previous image.
When the next icon on the last image is clicked, it should show the first image.
When the previous icon on the first image is clicked, it should show the last image.

Thanks for seeing what I had done!
